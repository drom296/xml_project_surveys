The plan for implementing the edit survey page

Have php generate the form based on the contents of the xml file

This procedure can be used for the add or edit

PHP
	// Every questions will be contained in a div for styling
	// the choices will be under the question, idented a little
		// as well as child nodes, that way on delete, we kill it and its children
	// for each item
		// grab the question
		// grab the choices
		// create the div for the question
		// add the question
		// loop through the choices
			// add each choice
	


JavaScript

// for each question div
	// add a link to add more choices
		// create a function to facilitate.
		// onclick add a single choice right before the link
		// (might not be needed)incrememt hidden field for number of choices for this question 7
		
	// add a link to add another question
		// create a function to facilitate.
		// onclick add a question div to the end of the question div list
	
	
--------------------------------------------
Processing
	
JavaScript

	// build the xml document based the questions and the choices as text and set
	// to the hidden xml field
	
	// create the root node
	// grab all the question divs
	// for each question div
		// build the question node
		// grab all the choices within this div
		//for each choice
			// create the choice node
			// attach to the question node
		// attach question to the root node
	// change the xml DOM to a string and set equal to the hidden xml field

PHP 
	// same as usual, except that the xml was attached to a hidden element
		// which means nothing to PHP, but this is the only field to grab
