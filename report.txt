The intent of this project was to create a robust online survey system. There 
would be two sides. One side was to allow users to take surveys and maybe even 
view the results of the surveys. The other side would be the administrative side.

From the administrative side, we allow them to add, edit, and delete surveys. 
We provide a dynamic way of editing/adding a survey, by allowing them to enter 
as many questions or choices for a survey.

The initial version of the website accomplished this by allowing the user to 
edit the xml directly. This was done so that we could focus on getting the XML 
technologies working harmoniously. Here we accomplished parsing of the xml files
via XPATH expressions, XSL Transformations, and XSD Schema validation. 

On the second phase of the project, we focused on user experience and moved away 
from direct XML. Instead we built a dynamic form that guided the user in 
building their survey. Once submitted, we re-build the xml, validate it, and add 
it to our pool of surveys.

We wanted to integrate AJAX into our website design, but the only place that 
made sense to add it was when adding/editing a survey. We were planning to show 
the incremental version of the XML document, as they were using the form to 
build it. This was scrapped when it was decided that the user wouldnâ€™t care.

All in all, the project went well.
